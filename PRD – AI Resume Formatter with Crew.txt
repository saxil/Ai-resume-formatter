PRD – AI Resume Formatter with CrewAI + RAG + Streamlit
📌 Project Name:
SmartResume.AI — Intelligent Resume Formatting Assistant

📋 Overview
SmartResume.AI is an AI-powered application that takes a resume in PDF format, extracts the content via OCR, intelligently formats and enhances the content using AI agents powered by CrewAI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and then exports a polished, ATS-friendly, and beautifully styled PDF resume. The UI is built with Streamlit for smooth interaction, and OpenRouter is used to call various LLM backends.
